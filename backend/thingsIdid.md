1. npm init

2. npm install express cors axios
   cors = call this server from anywhere in the internet
   axios = make api calls to chat engine . io

3. npm i --save--dev nodemon
   this is for running our node.js server in development mode

4. make nodemon run our node
   go to script in package json and add a attribute start and make the script in two quotes "nodemon index.js"

5. copied and pasted some code from here:
   https://blog.chatengine.io/fullstack-chat/nodejs-reactjs

6. npm run start to test in index.js

7. install rest client to test this all that its generating the usernames, this is the same shit as insomnia but its inbuilt, saves time innit

Youll be able to see the fake pw be generated in this too when you run it in REST client

8. now lets add proper authentication using chat engine io

rest.chatengine.io has all REST commands you need on there, just copy paste
